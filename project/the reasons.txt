Random Forest
-----------------
1.It's known for its high accuracy and robust performance across a variety of datasets
2.It works well with both categorical and numerical features, handling missing values and outliers effectively.
3.Random Forest provides a feature importance score, indicating which features have the most impact on the model's predictions. 
4.By aggregating predictions from multiple trees, it minimizes overfitting compared to a single decision tree model.
5.It can handle large datasets efficiently due to its ability to parallelize the training process.
6.It's less sensitive to noise and outliers in the dataset compared to some other models.

Decision tree
-----------------
1.Decision trees are easy to visualize and interpret,
  They mimic human decision-making by dividing the data into branches based on features.
2.They can handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable effectively. 
3.They're suitable for both numerical and categorical data without requiring extensive preprocessing.
4. They can handle both linear and non-linear relationships without the need for normalization.
5.They automatically select the most important features by placing them higher in the tree.
6.They are relatively fast to train and can handle large datasets.

SVM
-----------------
1.SVMs perform well even in high-dimensional spaces, making them suitable for tasks with many features.
2.They can model non-linear decision boundaries by using different kernel functions like polynomial,
  radial basis function (RBF), or sigmoid.
3.SVMs work well when there is a clear margin of separation between classes.
4.They aim to find the optimal hyperplane that maximizes this margin.
5.SVMs are less prone to overfitting, especially in high-dimensional spaces, compared to some other classifiers.

XGBClassifier
-----------------
1.It's an ensemble learning method that combines the outputs from multiple individual models (decision trees) to produce a strong,
  more generalized model.
2.It's optimized for speed and efficiency, making it scalable to large datasets.
3.XGBoost includes regularization techniques that help prevent overfitting, improving generalization to unseen data.
4.It can handle missing data effectively by learning how to treat missing values during the training process.
5. The flexibility of tuning hyperparameters allows for fine-tuning to improve performance for specific tasks.
6. XGBoost can be used for both classification and regression tasks, making it versatile across different problem types.

K-Nearest Neighbours
-----------------
1.KNN is conceptually simple and easy to understand. It doesn't involve any training process.
2.KNN is a non-parametric method, meaning it doesn’t make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
3.It can be used for both classification and regression tasks. In classification, the output is a class membership,
  and in regression, it's the average or median of the K-nearest neighbors.
4.Unlike models that require lengthy training periods, KNN has no training phase. It’s particularly useful when time is a constraint.
5. KNN’s predictions can be easily interpretable since it classifies new data points based on the majority class of their neighbors.

Stochastic Gradient Descent
-----------------
1.SGD works well with large datasets because it updates the model's parameters using a single training example at a time.
2.It's adaptable to different loss functions for classification, regression, and other tasks.
 This flexibility allows it to handle various types of problems.
3.It supports online learning, meaning it can continuously learn from new data in real-time, 
  which is beneficial in scenarios where the data is constantly changing or streaming.
4.It incorporates regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting, making it more robust against noisy data.
